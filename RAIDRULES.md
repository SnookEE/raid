# Raid Rules

#### Raid members are expected to be communicative, competant, conscientious  and prepared.

### Tl;DR

1. Why didn't you read it? Read it fucker.
2. [Addons](#Addons): Install the addons linked below.
3. [Communication](#Communication): Have discord and a microphone. Be able to communicate on voice.
4. [Competence](#Competence): Be able to perform at or above the average level for your class.
5. [Consumables](#Consumables): Have flasks, pots, food and runes.

## Addons

Not having these addons installed is the quickest and most egregious way to express your incompetance. 

[Exorsus Raid Tools](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/exorsus-raid-tools/download?client=y) is a tool for 
communicating to and managing raids. It lets the RL check the raids status, consumables, item level, weakauras and send
out notes to players.

[WeakAuras 2](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2/download?client=y) is an addon for creating graphics
and bars on screen to notify you of mechanics.

## Communication

Discord is required as well as a mic and the ability to express yourself adequatly in English (Sorry Ragnaros).
You don't need to know the in's and out's of every fight, that's the RLs job. What you need to do is be able to follow
instructions and make adjustments as well as communicate that you understand those adjustments and the reasoning
behind them. Once instructions are communicated to a member it's expected that you will follow them or communicate
the reason why you are unable or unwilling.

## Competence 

You should understand your class to a reasonable level and be able to perform the duties expected of that class at or
above the average performance on warcraftlogs for a particular fight. Members will only be benched on progression 
content in the most egregious situations. Expecially in flex raid heroic it generally shouldn't be neccesary.

Underperforming isn't the biggest deal in the world. If you are consistently underperforming you'll be benched, but
there are lots of people willing and able to go over logs and identify and fix performance issues with you. If you are
a compentant person that's able to communicate we should be able to fix those issues quickly and get you back into the
raid.

Fucking up. Fucking up is an interesting one. Sometimes people are tired. Sometimes people have poor reaction times
or get distracted. Sometimes there is RNG. We will do whatever we can to identify and fix these issues to keep you in 
the raid and contributing. Sometimes if you are screwing up on movement you'll be designated a partner to follow. 
Other times we will adjust the weak auras on the fly to help you deal with whatever mechanic is giving you trouble. 

## Consumables.

Flasks are expected of all members. Occasionally at the start of scheduled raids or during long progression
sessions flasks will be provided. When they are not, however, members are expected to have their own available.

Potions are required on every pull unless explicitly stated to not be. This will occur when there is an attempt to 
understand the mechanics of a fight and will be announced. Otherwise two potions per pull are expected, a pre-pot and
the second-pot.

Feasts will generally be provided on most pulls. On pulls where they are not provided members are expected to have and 
use personal food. Personal food will generaly be used on learning pulls.

Augment runes are not required on general farm pulls but will be required on progression content. They will follow the
same policy as potions.

The logic behind this is to get bosses down early and often. Bosses are tuned at the beginning of a patch such that they
are only able to be defeated by the average item level raid with consumables. We aren't here to not kill shit, so bring
your consumables.
