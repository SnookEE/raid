        <ul>
            <li>There is an additional mechanic not listed in the Dungeon Journal</li>
            <li>When the Kul’Tiran ship comes by, large Kul’Tiran boats appear on a side of Jaina’s boat</li>
            <li>You needed to click siege weapons to fire missiles at the Kul’Tiran boat, and kill it
                <ul>
                    <li>It takes 6 casts to kill the boat</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The boats will cast Bombard until you manage to kill them</li>
            <li>You’ll need to assign 2 players to be in charge of clicking the siege weapons to kill boats, one
                per side
            </li>
            <li>Additionally, these siege weapons can catch fire if hit by Bombard
                <ul>
                    <li>You can clear fire just like clearing Searing Pitch, with Avalanche or if Freezing Blast
                        hits them
                    </li>
                    <li>This is very important, so if any siege weapons get ignited, make sure someone with
                        Avalanche clears it
                    </li>

        <ul>
            <li>Tanks will need to regularly be moving Jaina around the room, positioned near an Unexploded
                Ordnance, roughly 10 yards from a barrel
                <ul>
                    <li>This makes it easy for Broadside targets to ensure one gets hit, but without nuking the
                        raid from a Broadside
                    </li>
                    <li>Remember to have the raid shift out before the barrel explodes</li>
                    <li>Also make sure to stay clear of the thicker, brighter ice patches on the ground</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Raid should be standing relatively close to Jaina. No more than about 7 yards away.
            </li>
            <li>If your stacks ever get too high, and you’re about to be frozen, run into melee range</li>

            <li>You should NOT use Broadside to hit a Barrel every cast of Broadside.&nbsp;
                <ul>
                    <li>Broadside is cast too frequently, you'll run out of Barrels long before it's possible to
                        push Jaina out of Phase 2
                    </li>
                    <li>Instead, use Broadside to hit a Barrel every SECOND cast.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Tanks continue swapping like Phase 1</li>
            <li>Siegebreaker Blast target GTFO</li>
            <li>Broadside targets 3 at a time. Depending which # cast this is, you either need all three players
                to move away, or two players move away with the 3rd standing on the assigned Barrel
                <ul>
                    <li>After Ice on a barrel is broken, swap to barrel and kill it ASAP</li>
                    <li>Make sure to stand in the circle to gain Warmth buff as long as possible</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Avalanche is always targeted at the active tank. You should drop off swirlies along the edge of
                the room
            </li>
            <li>Dodge Glacial Ray, watch out for the slight rotation</li>
            <li>Watch for Icefall, not just the initial impact but also the secondary comets shooting outwards
                from the direction of the arrow
            </li>
            <li>Do not get yourself frozen from stacks. Avoid standing in thicker ice patches to keep your rate
                of Chilling Touch stack gain low, and make sure to clear them every time a barrel is available
                <ul>
                    <li>Break out anyone who does get frozen into an ice block ASAP or they’ll die</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Phase ends at 30%</li>
            <li>Notes for graphic below:
                <ul>
                    <li>Orange is an example location to drop Avalanche. Always drop it near the edge of the
                        room, preferably where the raid has already moved away from
                    </li>
                    <li>Move Jaina around the room as necessary to avoid mechanics. The arrows are an example of
                        moving around to the Unexploded Ordinances. You may or may not be able to go this
                        direction, there's some RNG involved in where Arctic Ground ends up.

                        dealing Chilling Touch stacks

                        <ul>
                            <li>Places a shard of ice on a random player. After a short time, this player
                                explodes and deals frost damage to anyone near them, dealing 21k Frost damage

                            <li>Upon reaching 100 energy, the Tide Elemental casts Frost Nova, freezing everyone
                                within 12 yards in place for 8s and dealing 12k Frost to anyone hit.&nbsp;</li>
                            <li>Simple to avoid, just move away when it's about to cast. Note - this is an
                                instant cast, so pre-move before 100 energy
                            </li>

            </li>
            <li>While fighting the Elemental, free anyone that gets frozen into an Ice Block</li>
            <li>When Elemental is low, shift focus and free Nathanos from his ice block. Try to free him about
                the same time as the Elemental dies
                <ul>
                    <li>Once you free Nathanos, he'll go and attack Jaina 3 seconds later, interrupting her
                        Flash Freeze ability
                    </li>
                    <li>This pisses Jaina off, causing her to cast Arcane Barrage</li>
                    <li>This DOES need to be done before the Tide Elemental dies, though, as the Flash Freeze
                        can reach and cover this side area
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Arcane Barrage</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jaina channels power into her flying boat. The boat begins constantly throwing Arcane
                        bolts at the ground, shown by swirlies on the ground
                    </li>
                    <li>Swirlies deal 94k Arcane damage to anyone hit, and knocks them back</li>
                    <li>This ability is interruptible, and upon being interrupted, Intermission 2 ends and Phase
                        3 begins
                    </li>
                    <li>Raid must move quickly to get back into the encounter area where Jaina is, while dodging
                        every swirly so as not to get hit and knocked back
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>If you release Nathanos much earlier than you kill the Tide Elemental, Jaina still begins
                casting Arcane Barrage, meaning you'd need to deal with that AND the Elemental. Although you
                WILL need to release Nathanos before the Tide Elemental dies, in order to interrupt Flash Freeze
                before it covers the side area, you should delay this as long as possible. .

        <ul>
            <li>Phase 3 is a race to the finish. With no barrels left, you have no way to prevent people from
                being frozen. Instead, you’ll need to focus DPS on breaking out ice blocks ASAP
                <ul>
                    <li>Since every player will get frozen into an ice block at some point during phase 3, you
                        should attempt to stagger when people are frozen
                    </li>
                    <li>Easiest way to do this is assigning players to intentionally get frozen using the Arctic
                        Ground.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>You can either assign a handful of people to get frozen first, or even set up 3 groups
                        to take turns being frozen. Whichever works best for your group.

                <ul>
